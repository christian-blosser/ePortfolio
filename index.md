## Informal Code Review - [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/WIEzl36tGwA)

Code reviews can be characterized as a list of items to go over and ensure criteria is met.  This can be done by you, a developer, or one of your peers.  The items usually attempt to identify obvious errors, obvious logical errors, proper documentation, proper testing, format and styling abnormalities, proper functionality, and overall completeness (Radigan).  Essentially, a code review is an end to end review of the completed work done within a timeframe or as a complete product.  Specifically, this review encapsulates the three major projects for this course.

# Enhancements
## Overview
Below are the enhancements I have made.  All works below are provided by Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), recreations of works provided by SNHU, or are of my own implementation.

My first enhancement was to a project I completed in CS 405: Secure Coding.  In this project, we were assigned with finding security vulnerabilities and creating solutions to those findings.  Some of those findings were of original user error while others were created within the program in order to provide examples of different security issues.  The program was written by author, Curtis, on November 5, 2017 in the C++ language.  Overall, this program was a little difficult to interpret, as it was nearly comment free and I do not have extended experience in C++.  For this program’s enhancement, I chose to convert from C++ to Java.  This would entail converting every file and function into classes and methods for Java.

### Selection Process
Making a final selection on a project was a daunting task, however, as this will be used as a professional portfolio to showcase to possible employers, I needed to select a project that would stand out from others regarding both talent and reasoning.  There are a couple of different reasons why I chose this project over all the rest:
-	Versatility.  Being able to understand, interpret, and manipulate multiple computer languages is a valuable skillset to have.  Continuing programming in C++ would be excellent to make improvements but translating from language to language is an enormous skill to have in a world where there are hundreds of languages used every day.  In a cybersecurity career threats will not always appear in my desired language, so at the very least, versatility is being well prepared.
- Personal gain.  As mentioned, I know C++ language, but have not used it much.  As this project is written in C++, it was experience building for me to interpret C++ and translate it into a language that I know better.  Also, familiarity with Java made it easier for me to deal with some misinterpretations or lack of understanding in general.  Being able to grasp the concept of what was happening in C++ allowed me to implement my own design during the translation process.
- The source.  As this project had intentional and nonintentional errors, the learning experience with this program has been continuous.  As I was translating, I was finding errors that I did not catch in my code review.  This project has offered me deeper insight on how to catch errors and vulnerabilities, giving me experience and teaching me wisdom.
- Critical thinking and decision making.  There are files that were missing from this program and places where these files would have made the program sound and understandable.  Unfortunately, I was not provided those files from the source and had to make do with what I knew and what I did have.  This allowed me to analyze the program from different angles and decide what I could do in the different situations.  For example, a '.dat' file was referenced a number of times within the program, but I was not provided with the '.dat' file.  This made it a little more difficult, but I made the decision to work with multiple CSV files in order to implement a correct solution.
-	Never-before-seen implementations.  Most of this program made sense, while the rest was puzzling.  I have never dealt with usernames and passwords before, nor have I ever written a CSV file from code.  These translated implementations were a great challenge for me and utilized or expanded my knowledge base for this milestone.  These areas are currently functional, but I believe they still need further modifications for exceptionality.
- Lastly, the challenge.  Converting from one language to another is never a line by line translation.  Throughout this conversion, I have found myself with more lines of code in Java than the C++ counterpart, or vice versa.  Each language has their own flow, their own feel, and their own techniques to use.  C is the parent language to both C++ and Java, however, they each have a completely different style.  C++ is more closely related to C in that it could be used as a mid-level programming language while Java is at the top end and handles almost all the memory overhead itself.  The challenge of this conversion is rather exciting and fun to me.
### Reflection
As I began, I followed the flow of the program starting with the main function.  From here, there were calls made to other files.  Development was linear in respect to algorithmic runtime.  My process was simple regarding the steps in translation.  I would first assess the function and grasp the full concept or partial concept of what it was trying to accomplish.  Then, I would assess how it interacted with other functions such as variables passed or if passing variables would make it more efficient.  Next, I began the translation process trying to maintain line by line transfer.  Lastly, once the function was written, I would assess the need for improvement and implement it.  In short, I translated and improved the original source code.
The process was not all that simple, however.  I learned that reading files and manipulating file data seems to be simpler in C++ than in Java.  Most of my program was lengthened due to implementation of FileWriter, Scanner, and File manipulations in attempt to recreate the original functionality.  I also expanded my knowledge of C++ and Java programming.  Being naïve, I thought I had a good grasp of Java programming.  I stand corrected after undergoing countless hours of troubleshooting, revising, and researching due to improper implementation.  In one case, I forgot to close a Scanner object that had taken almost two hours of time to find and create.
I faced a few challenges along the way.  In addition to the things I have learned due to the challenges, I have also learned how to better manage time with the unknown.  As I mentioned earlier, I had worked on this capstone project for 31 hours this week in addition to maintaining my adult responsibilities such as working 40 hours, grocery shopping, feeding myself, and managing to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
