## Informal Code Review
My code review can be found [here](https://youtu.be/WIEzl36tGwA)

Code review can be characterized as a list of items to go over and ensure criteria is met.  This can be done by you, a developer, or one of your peers.  The items usually attempt to identify obvious errors, obvious logical errors, proper documentation, proper testing, format and styling abnormalities, proper functionality, and overall completeness (Radigan).  Essentially, a code review is an end to end review of the completed work done within a timeframe or as a complete product.  Specifically, this review encapsulates the three major projects for this course.



Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
